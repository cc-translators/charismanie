Requirements
============

  - pdf(la)tex
  - fourier-GUT, from http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/fourier-GUT
  - texlive-fonts-extra for fourier-orns

To build, type:

   make clean && make


Building and uploading
=======================

Type the following:

   make && make crocupload && make upload

You need two configuration files:

   - ~/.crocodoc.conf with a TOKEN variable with your crocodoc token
   - ~/.ncftp/cc.cfg with the FTP settings


PDF/X-1a compliance
===================

   - Get a preflight checker... PDF Studio Pro has one: http://www.qoppa.com/pdfstudio/demo/download.html
   - See http://support.river-valley.com/wiki/index.php?title=Generating_PDF/A_compliant_PDFs_from_pdftex
     for notes on how to fix some problems ;


Ebook generation
=================

After converting using htlatex, I had to do some changes in the HTML/CSS:

   - Replace all long __________ lines with <hr />
   - Make sure italic text is italic : .fxlri-t-1x-x-120{font-style:italic;}
   - Make sure title page is centered : .titlepage{text-align:center;}
   - Force page breaks with style="page-break-before: always" and h2 {page-break-before: always}
   - Remove ugly stuff placed instead of ToC (for some weird reason).

These changes are currently applied with cleanuphtml.sh, but it would be better to fix them upstream.
